Graphical User Interface (GUI): Eclipse WindowBuilder
Database Connectivity: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
Database Management System (DBMS): MySQL
Web-based Database Administration: phpMyAdmin
Local Server Environment: XAMPP

## Development Process
The system was developed using Java programming language with a focus on creating a user-friendly GUI for enhanced efficiency. Eclipse IDE, equipped with WindowBuilder, facilitated rapid development by simplifying the GUI design process. JDBC was utilized for database connectivity, with MySQL serving as the backend database managed via phpMyAdmin. XAMPP was employed to set up a local server environment for development purposes.
